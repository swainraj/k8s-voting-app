# K8s Kind Voting App

This project enables users to cast votes through a Python and Flask-based web interface. Voting data is then stored and managed within a Redis in-memory data structure. A .NET worker service processes these votes, and the final results are persisted in a PostgreSQL database ("db"). Users can then view the aggregated results through a separate interface.
